            In 2023 I went on an adventure with SheCodes for learning about Front-end development. I have currently completed the basic and plus course and will continue with the responsive and react course. I have learned a lot already and I am excited to learn more! Check out the projects that I made on this adventure.

          <p>
            In my free time, I like to wind down with some video games. This has been my hobby since I was a child. Some of my favorite games are still Pokémon and Final Fantasy and of course the party games like Mario Party, Mario Kart and Super Smash Brothers. My latest obsession however is Stardew Valley, winding down from work and taking care of my crops and animals!

          <p>
            One of the other ways I destress is by working on art projects! I have learned how to sew, how to knit and my recent art obsession: Macrame. Macrame is a crafting technique that uses knots to create various textiles.
